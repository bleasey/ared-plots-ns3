# Adaptive-RED Plots using NS-3

The aim of the project is to analyse the performance of Adaptive RED with changes in 'interval parameter' and plotting the folowing quantities: cwnd, q_length and number of proactive packet drops. 

The main file is a modified version of the adaptive-red-tests.cc example file from ns-3.
